This project is being created with educational purposes, if any of the icons/pictures being used has some ownership or protection, well... What can I do? I'm just someone trying to do something worth with my time.
So, let me practice and don't worry, this site is not going to make money (for now) hehehe.

And because i'm using the tailwind's CDN it's good for my future self to know that it's working with Tailwind v3.3.1
